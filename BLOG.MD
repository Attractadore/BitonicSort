# Part 1 -- Basic implementation of bitonic sort

Bitonic is a parallel sorting algorithm that is relatively easy to implement on the GPU.
For a more detail explanation, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter).

In this first part, I am going to talk how I implemented an unoptimized version of bitonic sort for integers.
